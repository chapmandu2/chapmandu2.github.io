      <description>My background I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bioinformatician for most of the 20 years since I graduated, but now I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist working for the Civil Service. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain why I made this change, and why I think all bioinformaticians should think of themselves as data scientists with a specialism in biology, rather than as a biologist with a specialism in computational science.
I started my career at AstraZeneca working in a genetics and sequencing lab, looking for variations in genes that might explain differential response to drugs.</description>

      <description>Today is my last day in the Drug Discovery Unit at CRUK-MI. There has been so much change this year it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to keep track! In April our previous group head Donald Ogilvie retired, and on the day he retired there was a serious fire at the Institute. We have subsequently relocated to Alderley Park, where I used to work when I was at Astrazeneca, which is causing me serious problems from a commuting perspective - rather than just over an hour on the train I now have to change trains and get a bus.</description>

      <description>I recorded a number of video tutorials before I left CRUK-MI on how to use various resources. These can be found on their own YouTube Channel or via the list below:
 Introduction to cell line data: Overview of data available and an explanation of different genomics data types and what they can be used for. Using IGV To Explore RNAseq Data: How to use the Broad Integrated Genomics Vieer to identify mutations and their consequences in RNAseq data Using the CCLE Genomics Explorer Shiny App To Identify Cell Lines : How to explore public domain cell line genomic data to identify suitable cell lines for further experimentation.</description>
