      <description>Introduction In the summer, James Hadfield from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and author of the Core Genomics blog wrote an excellent blog post where he described experimental considerations when carrying out RNA-seq experiments. He advocated generating 10-20M 50bp single end reads for a standard ‘microarray substitute’ differential gene expression experiment. Mick Watson of Opinionomics then raised the findings from a paper published by his group (Robert &amp;amp; Watson Genome Biology 2015) that some genes couldn’t be accurately quantitated due to the issue of multi-mapping: regions of similarity between closely related genes just can’t be differentiated between with shorter reads.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this example we do some very simple modelling using cancer cell line screening data and associated genetic data. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how data can be extracted from PharmacoSet objects and then be used to develop linear models of dose response vs genetic features. However, there are uncertainties around IC50 estimation and cell line genetic feature classification (and meaning) which aren’t carried through into the modelling.</description>
