      <description>Introduction Since starting at DWP Digital, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite a bit of time working with some colleagues developing our analysis environments. We need to be able to control and adapt our environments quite rapidly so that we can use the latest and greatest tools, but we also need these environments to be robust and reproducible and to be deployed in a variety of hosting contexts including laptops and our secure internal environment.</description>

      <description>My background I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bioinformatician for most of the 20 years since I graduated, but now I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist working for the Civil Service. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain why I made this change, and why I think all bioinformaticians should think of themselves as data scientists with a specialism in biology, rather than as a biologist with a specialism in computational science.
I started my career at AstraZeneca working in a genetics and sequencing lab, looking for variations in genes that might explain differential response to drugs.</description>
