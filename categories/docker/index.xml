      <description>Introduction This post is the first in a series of blog posts about getting the things that we do with R out into the world beyond the normal R ecosystem. I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about exploratory analyses, shiny apps, models, serverless functions, R packages, and Docker. A lot about Docker.
Why should you care? Why should you care about this? Well, if as a R user you can only really collaborate with other R users, you&amp;rsquo;re limiting yourself as a data scientist.</description>

      <description>Introduction Since starting at DWP Digital, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite a bit of time working with some colleagues developing our analysis environments. We need to be able to control and adapt our environments quite rapidly so that we can use the latest and greatest tools, but we also need these environments to be robust and reproducible and to be deployed in a variety of hosting contexts including laptops and our secure internal environment.</description>
