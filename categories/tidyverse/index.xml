      <description>Introduction This is a blog post to expand on a talk I gave at the Manchester R Users Group on 21st February 2017. In it I give a brief overview of the tidyverse and its core concepts, before going on to discuss how the same concepts can be applied to bioinformatics analysis using Bioconductor classes and packages.
 What is the tidyverse? The tidyverse is a suite of tools primarily developed by Hadley Wickham and collaborators at RStudio.</description>

      <description>Introduction I’ve been lucky enough to spend the last few days in sunny Florida at the RStudio::conf 2017. This was made possible by RStudio’s very generous academic discount scheme, so thanks to them for that! Whilst I’ve been tweeting a few of the key moments as they happened this series of posts expands further on these tweets and gives links to further information.
