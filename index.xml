      <title>Why bioinformaticians should consider themselves data scientists</title>

      <description>My background I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bioinformatician for most of the 20 years since I graduated, but now I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist working for the Civil Service. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain why I made this change, and why I think all bioinformaticians should think of themselves as data scientists with a specialism in biology, rather than as a biologist with a specialism in computational science.
I started my career at AstraZeneca working in a genetics and sequencing lab, looking for variations in genes that might explain differential response to drugs.</description>

      <title>Last day as a bioinformatician</title>

      <description>Today is my last day in the Drug Discovery Unit at CRUK-MI. There has been so much change this year it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to keep track! In April our previous group head Donald Ogilvie retired, and on the day he retired there was a serious fire at the Institute. We have subsequently relocated to Alderley Park, where I used to work when I was at Astrazeneca, which is causing me serious problems from a commuting perspective - rather than just over an hour on the train I now have to change trains and get a bus.</description>

      <description>I recorded a number of video tutorials before I left CRUK-MI on how to use various resources. These can be found on their own YouTube Channel or via the list below:
 Introduction to cell line data: Overview of data available and an explanation of different genomics data types and what they can be used for. Using IGV To Explore RNAseq Data: How to use the Broad Integrated Genomics Vieer to identify mutations and their consequences in RNAseq data Using the CCLE Genomics Explorer Shiny App To Identify Cell Lines : How to explore public domain cell line genomic data to identify suitable cell lines for further experimentation.</description>

      <title>Bioinformatics in the Tidyverse</title>
      <link>/post/2017/02/21/bioinformatics-in-the-tidyverse/</link>

      <description>Introduction This is a blog post to expand on a talk I gave at the Manchester R Users Group on 21st February 2017. In it I give a brief overview of the tidyverse and its core concepts, before going on to discuss how the same concepts can be applied to bioinformatics analysis using Bioconductor classes and packages.
 What is the tidyverse? The tidyverse is a suite of tools primarily developed by Hadley Wickham and collaborators at RStudio.</description>

      <description>Introduction I’ve been lucky enough to spend the last few days in sunny Florida at the RStudio::conf 2017. This was made possible by RStudio’s very generous academic discount scheme, so thanks to them for that! Whilst I’ve been tweeting a few of the key moments as they happened this series of posts expands further on these tweets and gives links to further information.
 RStudio::conf Highlights Days 1-2: shiny workshop RStudio::conf Highlights Day 3: the tidyverse RStudio::conf Highlights Day 3: the tidyverse   Applications of R Markdown Much of my day was spent listening to Yihue Xie talking us through an Advanced R Markdown tutorial as well as two conference presentations, one of which was on blogdown which I was excited about since it’s what I used to create this blog and has only been around a few months.</description>

      <title>RNAseq in preclinical drug discovery 1</title>
      <link>/post/2016/12/07/rnaseq-in-preclinical-drug-discovery-1/</link>

      <description>Introduction In the summer, James Hadfield from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and author of the Core Genomics blog wrote an excellent blog post where he described experimental considerations when carrying out RNA-seq experiments. He advocated generating 10-20M 50bp single end reads for a standard ‘microarray substitute’ differential gene expression experiment. Mick Watson of Opinionomics then raised the findings from a paper published by his group (Robert &amp;amp; Watson Genome Biology 2015) that some genes couldn’t be accurately quantitated due to the issue of multi-mapping: regions of similarity between closely related genes just can’t be differentiated between with shorter reads.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this example we do some very simple modelling using cancer cell line screening data and associated genetic data. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how data can be extracted from PharmacoSet objects and then be used to develop linear models of dose response vs genetic features. However, there are uncertainties around IC50 estimation and cell line genetic feature classification (and meaning) which aren’t carried through into the modelling.</description>

      <description>I was previously the Lead Scientist for Bioinformatics in the Drug Discovery Unit at the Cancer Research UK Manchster Institute. I used this experience to provide independent bioinformatics and drug discovery data science consultancy. My specialisms are preclinical drug discovery and cancer genetics, but take a look at my blog and projects to see if I might be able to help you!</description>
