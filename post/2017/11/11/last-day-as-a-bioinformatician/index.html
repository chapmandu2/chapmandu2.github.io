<p>Today is my last day in the Drug Discovery Unit at CRUK-MI.  There has been so much change this year it&rsquo;s been hard to keep track!  In April our previous group head Donald Ogilvie retired, and on the day he retired there was a serious fire at the Institute.  We have subsequently relocated to Alderley Park, where I used to work when I was at Astrazeneca, which is causing me serious problems from a commuting perspective - rather than just over an hour on the train I now have to change trains and get a bus.  When combined with the inevitable uncertainty that comes with a change in group management, it just seemed like a good time to move on from a job I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed for 5 years.</p>

<p>So what next?  Well I&rsquo;ve taken a job as a Data Scientist at DWP Digital.  I have no idea how this will turn out, but I&rsquo;m really looking forward to finding out how well what I&rsquo;ve learnt as a bioinformatician translates to a different role, and hopefully learning loads of cool stuff as well.  I see it as a no-lose proposition, if it&rsquo;s not for me I&rsquo;m sure I won&rsquo;t be any less qualified for a bioinformatics role than I am now, but if I enjoy it then it opens up a much deeper job pool than there is as a drug discovery bioinformatician, which is rather a niche of a niche.  We shall see!</p>
