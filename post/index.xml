      <description>Introduction This is the second post in a series about turning data science products written in R into products that can be consumed by technical and non-technical colleagues who don&amp;rsquo;t use R, without any significant additional infrastructure. As I discussed in more detail in the first post, this requires taking advantage of common DevOps workflows and approaches involving Docker.
Why Shiny? Most R users will have heard of Shiny, it is an R package that makes it exceptionally easy to turn some R code into an interactive web application.</description>

      <description>Introduction This post is the first in a series of blog posts about getting the things that we do with R out into the world beyond the normal R ecosystem. I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about exploratory analyses, shiny apps, models, serverless functions, R packages, and Docker. A lot about Docker.
Why should you care? Why should you care about this? Well, if as a R user you can only really collaborate with other R users, you&amp;rsquo;re limiting yourself as a data scientist.</description>

      <title>Last day as a civil servant</title>

      <description>Moving from bioinformatics to data science Almost exactly a year after contemplating my last day as a bioinformatician, I am now contemplating my last day as a data scientist in the Department for Work and Pensions, part of the UK civil service.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged about previously, bioinformatics experience is highly relevant in the data science job market, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also discovered how important the ‘science’ bit of data science is.</description>

      <description>Introduction Since starting at DWP Digital, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite a bit of time working with some colleagues developing our analysis environments. We need to be able to control and adapt our environments quite rapidly so that we can use the latest and greatest tools, but we also need these environments to be robust and reproducible and to be deployed in a variety of hosting contexts including laptops and our secure internal environment.</description>

      <title>Why bioinformaticians should consider themselves data scientists</title>
      <link>/post/2018/03/03/why-bioinformaticians-should-consider-themselves-data-scientists/</link>

      <guid>/post/2018/03/03/why-bioinformaticians-should-consider-themselves-data-scientists/</guid>
      <description>My background I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bioinformatician for most of the 20 years since I graduated, but now I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist working for the Civil Service. In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain why I made this change, and why I think all bioinformaticians should think of themselves as data scientists with a specialism in biology, rather than as a biologist with a specialism in computational science.
I started my career at AstraZeneca working in a genetics and sequencing lab, looking for variations in genes that might explain differential response to drugs.</description>

      <description>Today is my last day in the Drug Discovery Unit at CRUK-MI. There has been so much change this year it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to keep track! In April our previous group head Donald Ogilvie retired, and on the day he retired there was a serious fire at the Institute. We have subsequently relocated to Alderley Park, where I used to work when I was at Astrazeneca, which is causing me serious problems from a commuting perspective - rather than just over an hour on the train I now have to change trains and get a bus.</description>

      <title>Bioinformatics in the Tidyverse</title>
      <link>/post/2017/02/21/bioinformatics-in-the-tidyverse/</link>

      <guid>/post/2017/02/21/bioinformatics-in-the-tidyverse/</guid>
      <description>Introduction This is a blog post to expand on a talk I gave at the Manchester R Users Group on 21st February 2017. In it I give a brief overview of the tidyverse and its core concepts, before going on to discuss how the same concepts can be applied to bioinformatics analysis using Bioconductor classes and packages.
 What is the tidyverse? The tidyverse is a suite of tools primarily developed by Hadley Wickham and collaborators at RStudio.</description>

      <description>Introduction I’ve been lucky enough to spend the last few days in sunny Florida at the RStudio::conf 2017. This was made possible by RStudio’s very generous academic discount scheme, so thanks to them for that! Whilst I’ve been tweeting a few of the key moments as they happened this series of posts expands further on these tweets and gives links to further information.

      <title>RNAseq in preclinical drug discovery 1</title>
      <link>/post/2016/12/07/rnaseq-in-preclinical-drug-discovery-1/</link>

      <description>Introduction In the summer, James Hadfield from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute and author of the Core Genomics blog wrote an excellent blog post where he described experimental considerations when carrying out RNA-seq experiments. He advocated generating 10-20M 50bp single end reads for a standard ‘microarray substitute’ differential gene expression experiment. Mick Watson of Opinionomics then raised the findings from a paper published by his group (Robert &amp;amp; Watson Genome Biology 2015) that some genes couldn’t be accurately quantitated due to the issue of multi-mapping: regions of similarity between closely related genes just can’t be differentiated between with shorter reads.</description>

      <description>Introduction In this example we do some very simple modelling using cancer cell line screening data and associated genetic data. The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how data can be extracted from PharmacoSet objects and then be used to develop linear models of dose response vs genetic features. However, there are uncertainties around IC50 estimation and cell line genetic feature classification (and meaning) which aren’t carried through into the modelling.</description>
